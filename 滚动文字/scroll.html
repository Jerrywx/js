<h1>Scrolling Window Example</h1>
<p>This example shows a scrolling window created using JavaScript and
the W3C DOM. The red-bordered window below is actually a layer that
shows a clipped portion of a larger layer.</p>
<div id="thewindow">
<div id="thetext">
<p>This is the first paragraph of the scrolling message. The message
is created with ordinary HTML.</p>
<p>Entries within the scrolling area can use any HTML tags. They can
contain <a href="http://www.jsworkshop.com/">Links</a>.</p>
<p>There's no limit on the number of paragraphs that you can include
here. They don't even need to be formatted as paragraphs.</p>
<ul>
   <li>For example, you could format items using a bulleted list.</li>
</ul>
<p>The scrolling ends when the last part of the scrolling text
is on the screen. You've reached the end.</p>
